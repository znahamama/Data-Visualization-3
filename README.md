# 🎮 Console Sales & AI Gender Bias Visualizations

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook presents two distinct visualizations based on **global video game console sales** and **gender distribution in AI-generated occupation images**. The assignment leverages **`matplotlib`**, **`pandas`**, and **`pywaffle`** to replicate visualizations inspired by real-world datasets and news reports.

### 🌞 Global Console Sales by Company & Model

### 👥 Gender Representation in AI-Generated Occupations

The visualizations use **`pandas`**, **`matplotlib`**, and **`pywaffle`** to produce stylized charts reflecting data trends and biases.

## 🔍 Objective

### 📊 Part 1: Sunburst Plot of Console Sales
- Constructed a **sunburst plot** displaying:
  - **Inner ring** → Total units sold per brand (Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft)
  - **Outer ring** → Individual consoles, ordered clockwise by popularity
- Color-coded arcs, title labeling, and proportional slice sizes
- Follows strict formatting guidelines (e.g., console arc thickness and clockwise ordering)

---

### 🧇 Part 2: Waffle Charts on AI-Generated Gender Bias
- Built waffle charts for multiple occupations using `pywaffle`:
  - Each chart = 20x15 grid (300 total blocks)
  - Colors represent **women**, **men**, and **ambiguous** gender outputs
- Layout mimics Bloomberg’s “Generative AI Bias” article
- Enhanced with titles, white gridlines, and job-specific visual legends

## 📁 Files Included

- `Untitled.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with all code and visual output  
- `consoles.csv` – Console sales dataset  
- `gen-ai.csv` – AI-generated occupation gender classification dataset

## 📊 Visualization Summary

The notebook generates:
- A **sunburst visualization** showing company dominance and best-selling consoles globally
- Multiple **waffle charts** illustrating imbalanced gender representation across job prompts generated by AI tools
